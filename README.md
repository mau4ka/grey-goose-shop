# GreyShop

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.4.

# Task

I prefer to buy the goods from farmers and people who produce them by themselves and in small batches. I think these goods have better taste, are more natural and useful. But itâ€™s quite hard to find such producers and this is time-consuming. So as a customer I would like to have a possibility to see all local buyers of such products in one place. There should be possibility to view goods from a buyer, filter them by different categories of goods and so on. Also there should be information about buyers, their contact information, social networks .

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
